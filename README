koredis-config is a redis based config reader (and writer) for Kohana 3

It requires that phpredis is installed and can be downloaded at http://github.com/owlient/phpredis.

To use, replace Kohana::$config->attach(new Kohana_Config_File) with Kohana::$config->attach(new Config_Redis) inside your bootstrap.php file.
